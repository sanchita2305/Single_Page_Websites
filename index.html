            <p>As a business, you grow by controlling cost and maximizing profits. As you acquire small businesses that are ancillary services, you not only control the cost of your primary business, but you gain the clients and customers of those ancillary businesses—not to mention the introduction into new areas of business or industries not originally served by you, through a partner they already have grown to trust.</p>
            <img src = "images/intro-2.jpg" alt = "">
            <p>Many businesses are not adequately prepared for hiring today’s younger workforce. You need to plan ahead and learn about the potential strengths and weaknesses of the age group, then rework your interview questions to best highlight the talent you are looking to hire. It is also important to learn how to speak to workers in a way they will understand the importance of their responsibilities, tasks, and place in your organization.</p>>    
            <p>Develop short-term goals: quarterly, semi-annual, or annual, and create a plan that will help you reach those goals. Make sure your plan considers the resources you may need: cash, people, equipment, inventory, and additional operating costs, and make sure the end result will be a service or product that customers are looking for. Set the metrics you will use to monitor your progress towards attaining that goal; adjust your plans as needed based on how close or far you are from your goal. If you aren't meeting your goal, determine why you are not meeting it: Is it lack of resources? Is marketing not working? Are you targeting the right customer segment?</p>

                <p></p>If you are a retailer with no online presence, consider setting up a web store as another way to capture sales. Once you have captured enough customer emails, consider an email campaign to keep your message in front of your customer base. And don’t forget about social media.</p>
                <p>If you’re an online-only business, consider a direct mail campaign, including a catalog featuring your best sellers for prospecting to new potential buyers. After testing a multichannel approach, you will be able to determine how to best spend your marketing dollars based on which channels were most effective in reaching your sales goals.</p>

                <p>Businesses need to prepare and strengthen their cyber infrastructure, not simply to be ready for the next threat, but, more important, to position their companies to take advantage of the opportunities provided by a strong information security posture. The overwhelming cascade of messages communicated to small business owners emphasizes the ongoing threat that malicious software and cybercriminal elements pose to the security of their digital information.</p>
                <p>Businesses need to challenge themselves now to harden their business’s information security infrastructure, positioning and strengthening their business to be ready for the requirements expected from larger corporate and government entities. Consider information security not so much a protection against a threat, but as an investment to grow in a digital economy.</p>

            <h3>Hi, I’m Jonah Altman.</h3>
            <p class = "italic">I Help Businesses Increase Sales, Boost Their Profits and Build a Winning Marketing Strategy.</p>
            <p>Creating sound systems and processes are essential in finding anomalies in costs and revenues to refine profitability. Point of sale systems; inventory management; and bookkeeping practices, processes, and procedures will help ensure you can find out what’s wrong faster. It’s often easy for business owners who have been in business for a while to rely on qualitative data and therefore neglect quantitative data that is easily found. For example, a retailer may think that a particular product is flying off the shelves, but after looking at the numbers, realize that's not the case.</p>
            <p>While it's not a line on the profit and loss statement, it is important for business owners to be intentional about identifying and quantifying opportunity cost in their business. Opportunity cost shows up in number of ways. The most common example is a business owner who spends time on tasks or areas of the business that are not the best use of their time or talent. While they may be saving on the cost of hiring for or outsourcing that work, they are actually costing themselves more by tying up their time, and often doing the job poorly. Another example is businesses that take on clients who aren't the best fit. </p>
            <p>Owning your own business can create a lonely world: you make decisions on your own, you might find a few successes that no one else sees, and you worry all by yourself. Build your tribe of advisers, counselors, guides, and good friends who can offer input, join your celebrations, and help you find the light at the end of the long, dark tunnels.</p>
